ArduinoSensorBoard
Firmware for arduino which provide reading sensors and controlling switches functionality and controlled throw nRF24l01+ with ControllerBoard
Goals:
	recive command from ControllerBoard(addres both Controller and sensor is static and can be changed fom serial connection)
	read sensors
	write switch relay
	send result of command

Controller/driver
	daemon in raspberry pi which provide interface from CotrollerInterface to NRF24l01+ tranciever
Goals:
	read from db a packet
	send throw nRF24l01+ packet to addres that parsed from input packet
	recive throw nRF24l01+ packet 
	write the packet to db
