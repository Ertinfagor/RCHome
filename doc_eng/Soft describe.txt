ArduinoSensorBoard
Firmware for arduino which provide reading sensors and controlling switches functionality and controlled throw nRF24l01+ with ControllerBoard
Goals:
	recive command from ControllerBoard(address both Controller and sensor is static and can be changed fom serial connection)(alpha)
	read sensors(alpha)
	write switch relay(not ready)
	send result of command(alpha)

Controller/driver
	daemon in raspberry pi which provide interface from db to NRF24l01+ tranciever
Goals:
	read from db a packet(beta)
	send throw nRF24l01+ packet to address that parsed from input packet(alpha)
	recive throw nRF24l01+ packet (alpha)
	write the packet to db(beta)
